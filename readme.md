# Stringman

Stringman (short for "string manipulator") aims to make some of the common types of string manipulation easier. Most of the functionality contained within Stringman isn't particularly difficult to write, but the value it provides lies within the fact that Stringman has an ever-growing collection of functionality that will save you time and headaches. A lot of the typical regular expression scenarios that JavaScript developers encounter are covered here.

Stringman is in the very early stages right now and I am still figuring out how I want to structure this and what functionality to include. Examples of the type of functionality include (but are not limited to):

- validate whether string is url
- return text from inside of parenthesis
- validate whether string is a valid semantic version
- remove an email address from a string
- much more

Also, typescript types are included.

## Install
```
npm i -S stringman
```

## Contributing
I haven't though too much about this yet as the project is very young. Just contact me if you are interested in contributing.
