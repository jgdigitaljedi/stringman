# Stringman

### NOT YET PUBLISHED TO NPM

Stringman is in the very early stages right now. The idea behind this library is to provide a simple way to do common string manipulation and regular expression matching/testing on strings in the fastest and simplest way possible. Examples of the type of functionality include (but are not limited to):
- validate whether string is url
- return text from inside of parenthesis
- validate whether string is a valid semantic version
- much more

I will be adding to this as I have a chance and will publish to npm soon. In the meantime, you can check out the [documentation](https://jgdigitaljedi.github.io/stringman/) and tinker around if you want!
