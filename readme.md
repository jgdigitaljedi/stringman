# Stringman

This is intended to be npm package written in TypeScript that has many methods for string manipulation and regex. The idea is to write something that has similar functionality to a package like lodash but that does wildly different operations for you. An example of this would be a method that removes anything between parenthesis for you. Once I get a decent chunk written, I'll update the readme and publish the package.
