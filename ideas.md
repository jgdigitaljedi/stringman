# Ideas

Just a file where I can jot down my ideas of functionality to add to this library.

## colors

- hsl color conversions
- color array generation

## password

- forbidden characters
- password strength

## whitespace

- remove all
- swap methods for various whitespace
- split methods for tabs, new lines, and carriage returns
- combine method that takes array and returns as string delimited by new lines. Maybe even have options starting line with a hyphen like in a md list.

## escapes

- remove escapes
- add escapes
- retrieve escaped characters

## HTML tags

## Dates

## Time

## File Path

## Zipcode
